# Specification - WRK-BLUE

## Agent brief

Update the primary application background to blue. The background must resolve to `#2563EB`, and an automated check must verify the computed CSS color. This change applies to the primary app background only; it does not redefine other visual tokens or application behavior.

## Actors

- **Application user:** Views the application with the updated primary background.
- **Developer or verifier:** Confirms the rendered primary background resolves to the required color.

## User scenarios

### S1 - View the application with the updated background

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Application user
**Context:** The application is loaded in a supported browser.

- **Given** the primary application background is rendered
  **When** the user views the application
  **Then** the primary application background appears blue with the value `#2563EB`.

### S2 - Verify the background color

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Developer or verifier
**Context:** The application can be rendered for automated testing.

- **Given** the application is rendered
  **When** the automated color check reads the computed CSS color of the primary application background
  **Then** the computed color represents `#2563EB`.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** Not applicable; this change does not introduce records or an empty-data state.
- **Failure:** If the rendered background does not resolve to `#2563EB`, the automated check fails.
- **Partial:** A change to a child surface without changing the primary application background does not satisfy this specification.

## Permissions

No application permission changes are required. All application users see the updated primary background.

## Boundary conditions

- The required color value is exactly `#2563EB`.
- The target is the primary application background, not a button, text color, icon, border, or secondary panel.
- The automated assertion must inspect the computed CSS color after rendering.

## Requirements

- The application shall set its primary background color to `#2563EB`. *(S1)* [WRK-BLUE:REQ-001]
- The project shall include an automated check that renders the application and verifies the computed CSS color of the primary background represents `#2563EB`. *(S2)* [WRK-BLUE:REQ-002]

## Acceptance criteria

- A rendered application shows the primary background as `#2563EB`. *(S1)* [WRK-BLUE:AC-001]
- The automated color check passes only when the primary background's computed CSS color represents `#2563EB`. *(S2)* [WRK-BLUE:AC-002]

## Non-functional requirements

- The automated color check must be deterministic: it shall compare the computed color against the single specified `#2563EB` value after the application renders. [WRK-BLUE:REQ-003]

## Constitution articles

No constitution article IDs were provided by the governed inputs for this work item.

## Assumptions

- The primary application background is represented by a renderable CSS-styled element that an automated test can inspect.

## Out of scope

- Changing any visual surface other than the primary application background.
- Redesigning the application's color system, layout, typography, behavior, or permissions.
